        But there was a big problem waiting for you in this dense forest. To make it out alive,
        you have to solve three tricky puzzles at different levels. Don't worry though,
        I'm ETHAN HUNT, and I'll be there to help you and explain everything as we go along. W
        e'll work together to solve the mysteries of the forest and overcome the challenges.
        Trust me, we'll beat the odds and enjoy this exciting adventure that fate has given us.
        Do you want to continue the adventure?"

  utter_help:
    - text: "This is a text based adventure game. You're able to pick up items and you're
        also able to combine them in order to solve puzzles. You can try to `look` and
        items, you might be able to `pick up` items and you can try to `use` items on
        other objects. Before you're able to combine items you first need to pick them
        up. If you get stuck, feel free to ask for a hint!"
